Exercice Log
============
 
This is a personal project to explore different tools for data processing, exploration and visualisation, using a fitness exercise data set. For historical reasons, the input data is stored as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) so part of the fun is converting the input into something more usable. 

Initial implementation uses an [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) notebook.

Work is in progress on [Elastic Search](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) + [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) implementation.
